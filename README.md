# dragonfly.vim

Vim global plugin for dragging and copying blocks and lines
Typical shortcuts:

```
xmap <left>  <plug>(dragonfly_left)
xmap <right> <plug>(dragonfly_right)
xmap <down>  <plug>(dragonfly_up)
xmap <up>    <plug>(dragonfly_down)
xmap P       <plug>(dragonfly_copy)
```

Inspired by Damien Conway's [More Instantly Better Vim](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2013/public/schedule/detail/28875). This was originally meant to be a fork, but it ended as a complete rewrite, greatly improving performance and fixing many edge cases.
